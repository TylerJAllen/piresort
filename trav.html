      <h2 class="allotherheadings">The best part about vacationing at Squirrel Island is the false sense of relaxation that all guests feel when they begin their travel to the squirrel kingdom of the Pacific.</h2>
      <p>Unbeknownst to you, our guest, the travel arrangements are quite cumbersome. On your voyage to Squirrel Island, we believe it is paramount to lay the foundation of dread and uncomfortableness before you even set foot on the sacred soil of the squirrels. Here are all the possible ways of travelling to this tropical nightmare:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boat</li>
        <li>Canoe</li>
        <li>Jet Ski</li>
        <li>Swim (highly recommended for the faint of heart)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As you can see, there are many wonderful ways of getting here. Please note: once you arrive, all boats are required to leave without passengers (all incoming rides are one-way trips).</p>
