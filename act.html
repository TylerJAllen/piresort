      <p>Although guests come to Squirrel Island through false-promises of relaxation and privacy, most of them spend their entire time trying to escape by land or sea. You can choose from one of our many fun activities to attempt to escape this haven of squirrels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Snorkeling with makeshift snorkels made from used PVC pipes (not up to safety codes)</li>
        <li>Canoeing with small holes in every vessel</li>
        <li>Running from rabid squirrels (great workout!)</li>
        <li>and a lot more activities that used to exist before the squirrels took over...</li>
      </ul>
