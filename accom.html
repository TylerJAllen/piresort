      <p>When you arrive at Squirrel Island, many of your newfound worries will be squirrel related as you struggle to find relaxation. They are in the leaking above-ground pool, at the water's edge, and on the brittle sun-damaged plastic lawn chairs located on the back patio overlooking the latest not-so-legal sewage disposal that we kindly ask you not to report to the local authorities. The squirrels are everywhere. And, they are nowhere. They are everywhere and nowhere at the same time.</p>
      <h4 class="h2accom">Squirrel Island distills the island dream to it's purest, simplest form - just you, alone with the squirrels. Available rental properties:</h4>
